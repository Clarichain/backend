# Contribution Guidelines

## Branching Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code only
- `dev`: Ongoing development (PRs are merged here first)
- Feature branches: `feature/<feature-name>`
- Fixes: `fix/<bug-name>`

## Steps to Contribute
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/feature-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with meaningful message: `git commit -m "feat: added X"`
5. Push and create a Pull Request to `dev` branch

## Code Style
- Use Prettier
- Follow existing conventions

## Pull Request Rules
- Title must be in format: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore: ...`
- Add clear description
- Tag reviewers
